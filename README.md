# GuessingGame
A simple number guessing game I made in Python last year. It was one of the first projects I did and I have kept the code the way I initially made it. 

The game is simple with two options. For the first option, the user guesses a number between 1 and 100 and see how many times it takes to do it. The 2nd option is to watch the program do it in a dummy fashion by means of a random number generator.
